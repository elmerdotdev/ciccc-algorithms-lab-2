// Exercise 4: Write a function `mostFrequentChar` that takes a string and returns the character
// that appears the most times. If there is a tie, return the first character that reaches the maximum frequency.
// Example: mostFrequentChar("javascript") should return "a".

console.log(mostFrequentChar("javascript")); // Expected output: "a"
